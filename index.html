                        Hi there! I am Todd I am the proud father of a pretty awesome 6 year old boy. 
                        I grew up in a small town in rural South Carolina called Ninety Six... Yes it is a real place.
                        I have two amazing parents who have been married for over 50 years now. I also have an older sister 
                        and a niece and a nephew!

                        <br>
                        I graduated from Clemson University in 2007 and enjoy making my way back to campus whenever I can usually for Football games on Saturdays.
                        I currently live in Charleston, South Carolina and have called this wonderful place home for around 15 years now! In my free time 
                        I enjoy gaming, beach and pool days, along with supporting our local sports teams and checking out some of our fantastic local restaurants and breweries!

                        <h3>Gaming!</h3>
                        <img src="./assets/images/Computer.jpg" alt="gaming set up" />
                        <p>
                            My biggest hobby by far is gaming. It has always been a part of my life since I was 4 years old and received an NES for Christmas in 1989. I run a small twitch channel that can be found at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/chucktowntiger"> twitch.tv/chucktowntiger </a>. 
                            I play a variety of games and use them as a way to keep in touch with old friends who are no longer located near by! Some of my current favorite games include Escape from Tarkov, League of Legends, Rocket League, and Retro Games as well.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Shows!</h3>

                        <p>
                            No hobby list is complete without also relaxing on the couch with a drink in one hand and a show on the TV. Some of my favorites include about anything from the Star Wars universe including the cartoon series! I am extremely excited for the upcoming Obi Wan show.
                            He is by far my favorite character from the Star Wars Universe. I enjoy the Witcher and other "nerdy" shows along with a lot of crime dramas and about anything serial killer related. Recently I have started watching a few anime shows that were recommended to me by friends.

                        <h3>Legos!</h3>
                        <img src="./assets/images/Legos.jpg" alt="lego collection" />
                        <p>
                            I also enjoy putting together Legos with my son. I have built many of the space related ones such as the Saturn V, ISS, Apollo Lander and the Space Shuttle! I also own a few of the Star Wars sets as well. My 6 year old is also getting into
                            Legos these days and building them with him has been a blast! I also have built a few Military style "Legos" from an alternative brand called Cobi!

                        <p>
                            When I have a chance I also enjoy playing golf and have started to get my son into it as well. I am pretty terrible but it is good to get out doors and move around when I am usually couped up inside an office for most of the day!
